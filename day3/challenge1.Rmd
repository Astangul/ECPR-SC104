Now it's your turn to practice! Open a connection to the Streaming API and collect a sample of tweets based on keywords that you may find interesting. Keep it open for about a minute.

```{r}

```

Then, read it in R and check who are the most popular users and which hashtags were used the most during this period. What do you find?

```{r}

```

Turning to the REST API, collect the 2,000 most recent tweets from a Twitter account that you find relevant. Then, look at the most popular hashtags.

```{r}

```

Using the code we ran earlier, produce a word cloud with the most frequent words in that account's tweets. What does it tell you?

```{r}

```
